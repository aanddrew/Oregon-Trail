# Oregon-Trail
Oregon Trail clone

This was the final project for my intro cs class if you didn't want to make your own.
I did not turn this work in I simply did it as an excercise.

I did it without any pointers since I got a little carried away with the last project.

All in all it was actually decently fun. I don't think this version is very well balanced,
but I'm not super interested in looking at this code anymore.

//Just to protect myself:
This code was written by Andrew Weller and nobody else may claim it as their own.
